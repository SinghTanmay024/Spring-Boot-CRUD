When you're working with a Spring Boot project, one of its key features is the embedded web server that comes built-in. Spring Boot simplifies the deployment process by packaging your application along with an embedded web server, eliminating the need for external web server configurations.

Embedded Web Server:

Spring Boot includes several embedded web servers, such as Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow.
By default, Spring Boot uses an embedded server (e.g., Tomcat) without requiring any external server setup.
